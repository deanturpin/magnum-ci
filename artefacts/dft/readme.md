// DFT is a header-only discrete Fourier transform implementation written in
// Modern C++. Libraries often use optimisations that restrict dimensions of
// the sample array (power of two) but without these limitations we can explore
// the algorithm and apply it where we couldn't use a "fast" implementation. It
// was originally written to study the characteristic spectral response of my
// various musical instruments but it can be applied in other domains. The
// calculate() routine takes a pair of STL container iterators and returns the
// Fourier transform as a vector of bins. We could consider parallelising the
// matrix calculation but I've elected to keep the library simple
// (single-threaded) and delegated the multi-core utilisation to the makefile:
// the build process generates multiple images in parallel.

# BAMBOO DRONE
[![](wav/bamboo_drone.png)](wav/bamboo_drone.png)
A cheap bamboo didge with a Sugru mouthpiece. Fundamental of 73 Hz (D2), with
lots of harmonics across the whole frequency range. Interestingly it's skipping
every other overtone. An unrefined sound and quite difficult to play (poor back
pressure).
Listen to the [audio](wav/bamboo_drone.wav).
# DIDGERIDOO BIG TONY DRONE
[![](wav/didgeridoo_big_tony_drone.png)](wav/didgeridoo_big_tony_drone.png)
Fundamental of 58 Hz (Bb1). Key intervals are 1, 3, 5 and 7 which is Bb Major 7.
This didgeridoo was liberated from the dump and is probably Eucalyptus:
woolybutt, bloodwood and stringybark have been suggested. Very good back
pressure.
Listen to the [audio](wav/didgeridoo_big_tony_drone.wav).
# DIDGERIDOO BIG TONY TOOT
[![](wav/didgeridoo_big_tony_toot.png)](wav/didgeridoo_big_tony_toot.png)
The toot has a fundamental of 178 Hz (F3) which is a fifth above the drone.
There's also lots of activity in the higher frequencies at least up to 4 KHz.
Listen to the [audio](wav/didgeridoo_big_tony_toot.wav).

# HOBGOBLIN DIDGE 8000
[![](wav/hobgoblin_didge_8000.png)](wav/hobgoblin_didge_8000.png)
Peaks at 75, 149, 224, 299 374, 448 Hz.

Fundamental of 75 Hz is somewhere between D2 and D#2. The first octave isn't
very strong but the next few overtones have equal presence. Overall it's
probably tending towards a D-Major.

```
73.42	D2
220.00	A3
293.66	D4
369.99	F#4
440.00	A4
```
Listen to the [audio](wav/hobgoblin_didge_8000.wav).
# JF FIBREGLASS SLIDE
[![](wav/JF_fibreglass_slide.png)](wav/JF_fibreglass_slide.png)
Fibreglass didge. A fundamental of 82 Hz (E2). First octave, fifth (B3) and
second octave all quite strong.
Listen to the [audio](wav/JF_fibreglass_slide.wav).
# KP GUEST
[![](wav/KP_guest.png)](wav/KP_guest.png)
Fundamental of 83 Hz (E2) with two octaves and a fifth (B). There's also a
hint of 403 Hz (a slightly sharp G4): a minor third. See [the
scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_minor) on Wikipedia.
Listen to the [audio](wav/KP_guest.wav).
# PIANOBB2
[![](wav/pianoBb2.png)](wav/pianoBb2.png)
Striking the A2 key on a baby grand piano (no pedal).
Listen to the [audio](wav/pianoBb2.wav).
# SINGING BOWL1
[![](wav/singing_bowl1.png)](wav/singing_bowl1.png)
Fundamental of 469 Hz (close to A#4) and first octave of 936 Hz. The only bowl
with a pronounced octave.
Listen to the [audio](wav/singing_bowl1.wav).
# SINGING BOWL2
[![](wav/singing_bowl2.png)](wav/singing_bowl2.png)
Fundamental of 90 Hz, close to F2. Significant peaks at 259 Hz and 517 Hz
(fifths). Very complex response, I suspect this is a hand-made metal bowl. (I
recorded the bowls in the dark so I'm not sure which video was which.)
Listen to the [audio](wav/singing_bowl2.wav).
# SINGING BOWL3
[![](wav/singing_bowl3.png)](wav/singing_bowl3.png)
Fundamental exactly 261 Hz (C4). Maybe a touch of a fifth but really very little
overtone presence.
Listen to the [audio](wav/singing_bowl3.wav).
# SINGING BOWL5
[![](wav/singing_bowl5.png)](wav/singing_bowl5.png)
Extremely pure fundamental of 298 Hz. Halfway between D4 and D#4.
